### Project Description
[SmartShop Connect" bridges the gap between online convenience and offline shopping by allowing retailers to showcase collections and offers digitally. Customers can browse products, shortlist items, and visit stores for tactile evaluation of clothing and footwear. The platform includes a "Retailer Dashboard" for inventory management and a "Customer Interface" with filters, real-time inventory updates, and GPS navigation. Key features include personalized recommendations, wishlist functionality, and enhanced sensory experiences for try-before-you-buy items. It uses a scalable technical framework with Python-based backend, centralized databases, and APIs. This platform empowers local retailers and enhances the offline shopping experience.]

### The Problem statement
[The key problem being addressed by SmartShop Connect is the lack of integration between online and offline shopping experiences.
1.For customers: They often face difficulties finding specific items in local stores without having to visit multiple locations. Online shopping, while convenient, lacks the tactile and sensory experience of physically evaluating items like clothing and shoes.
2.For retailers: Small and local retailers struggle to showcase their inventory and offers digitally, making it harder to attract tech-savvy customers who rely on online platforms for shopping decisions.]

### The Solution
[SmartShop Connect provides a hybrid platform that combines the best of both online and offline shopping. 
1.Retailer Dashboard:
Retailers can upload their inventory (including pictures, sizes, colors, and other details).
Enables digital showcasing of their collections and offers.
Provides real-time updates to ensure accurate product availability.
2.Customer Interface:
Customers can browse products using filters for size, color, and style.
Shortlist items they like and find stores with GPS navigation to visit and evaluate products physically.
Personalized recommendations enhance the shopping experience.
A wishlist functionality helps them keep track of preferred items.]
